# TablaStrokeAnalysis

## Overview
This is my work as part of a bigger project on the development of a system that determines the quality of tabla (a popular Indian hand percussion instrument) strokes played real-time by novice students of the instrument. 
I extracted and analyzed envelope features like sustain duration, harmonic and baseline features like spectral variance, MFCC, from audio files of multiple tabla stroke samples I recorded.
